        **IMPORTANT:** When brew fails, it tells you where the full logs are
        located. You MUST provide the complete log file contents.


        To get the full log:

        1. Look for a message in your terminal like: "Last 15 lines from
        /path/to/Logs/Homebrew/..."
           - macOS: Usually in `/Users/username/Library/Logs/Homebrew/formula-name/`
           - Linux: Usually in `/home/username/.cache/Homebrew/Logs/formula-name/`

        2. Navigate to that directory and open the log file

        3. Copy the entire contents and paste them here


        Without the full log, we cannot diagnose compilation issues!
